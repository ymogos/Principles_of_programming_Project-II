# Principles_of_programming_Project-II
This chess program is a simplified version of the traditional game, featuring only two pieces: the King and the Rook. In this game, one player competes against the computer, controlling the King, while the computer controls the Rook. The objective is for the player to move the King strategically to avoid being captured by the Rook. The program employs basic chess rules, where the King can move one square in any direction, while the Rook moves horizontally or vertically across the board. The challenge lies in avoiding the Rook’s attacks while trying to maneuver the King to safety. The computer, acting as the opponent, uses an algorithm to track the King's position and make calculated moves to corner the player’s King, creating a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.
